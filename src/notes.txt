    (get importnat variables for the description as: gardens, roof, vigilancy,
  - location (transform to a more specific colony)
  - timestamp
  - description 
    (get sentiment of description)
    (get importnat variables for the description as: gardens, roof, vigilancy, parking lot, etc)
  - vendor
  - lat & long:
    (spatial join with agebs)
  - price_mod/final_price/price_square_meter
  - since period:
    (transform all date to one single time unit (day, months, etc))
  - since value
  - days on site
  - amenities
  - bathrooms
  - cellars
  - num floors
  - monthly fee
  - apartments per floor

#### ageb joins in R ####
1. transform lat-long to lcc (mexico)
2. important mexican databases:
  - mexican margination (conapo)
  - joins espaciales: https://bookdown.org/martinmontaneb/CienciaDeDatosParaCuriosos/datos-espaciales-en-r.html
  - tocar puntos a poligonos: join vs within vs touches/en vs dentro vs sobre
  - within distance
  -

# spatial analysis

- There were only 3 states considered: 02, 09, 19, that are
baja california, cdmx and nuevo leon

- there were 7 municiaplities considered

- there were 49 distinct agebs

- looking at the data, it doesnt look soo clear the distinction of price between agebs

# out variables
- num_floors is out cause 91.4% of the data is empty 
- ap per florr has 98.4% of na's
- disposition has 97.9%
- floor_situated
- department_type
-

# notes
there is an outlier in id=546, then i get rid of it

# y: transf
- no se modifica por boxcox con metodo de loglike

#- random forrest
1. m2 gives a powerful interpretation of the value (yup)
2. since_days_value isnt linear (can be spurius)
3. emotion_descr looks something interesting their prediction values
4. has rooftop yup
5. amenities yup
aux. baths, cellars, parking lots, num_bedrooms, roof, is_new, 
6. locality for cdmx in condesa-roma is really good (create new feature!)
  (Alvaro Obregón / Alvaro Obregón / cuauhtemoc / miguel hidalgo) vs others
7. pea looks interesting
8. tvivtot also looks promosing 
9. vivpar_hab_ratio
10. pobtot
11. p18a24a_ratio

# rf2: ok
- maybe take out: cellars & 
- p18a24 or p_18a24
- corr between baths & rooms
- the ratio was tried but wasnt significative


# trees
more or less

# linear models
noup

# better to explain with rf

# consideraciones
the sample was taken from luxury departments. Therefore the model are baised
to this and that's one of the causes that the models params are counterintuitive
